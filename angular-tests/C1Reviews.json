The staff was super friendly and the doctor I had, Drew, was very informative and made sure I was a-okay before they sent me on my way. I would definitely recommend and God forbid the need ever occurs, I will use them again.",

I did register online, which I recommend, because of the convenience. The two employees at the front desk were very friendly and professional. I saw the Nurse Practitioner, Erica, who was also really friendly with excellent bedside manner. She assessed my symptoms and prescribed accordingly.

They diagnosed him, gave him care instructions, sent him over Tamiflu and did a chest X Ray because he is prone to pneumonia sent an antibiotic for that. Maybe there from start to finish an hour and that is during flu season. Very clean. The one lady was even sanitizing the doors after so many people walked through. What an excellent urgent care.

They were very busy when we originally came in on Saturday afternoon & let us know the aprx wait time, couldn’t wait that long bc our other child had to be somewhere in a couple hours & it wasn’t EXTREMELY urgent. We told them we’d be back in the morning & the ladies had everything ready & waiting as soon as we came in!

Being a nurse myself I have high expectations for the care I receive. Everyone was attentive to the signs and symptoms I’ve been having and my visit wasn’t rushed at all. I believe the NP really did a thorough evaluation and exam on me to try and figure out what was causing my illness. I wouldn’t definitely come back here in the future if ever need be.

					"comment":"Excellent! I felt the need to go to Urgent Care about 5:15. Went online and found I could book an appt. for 5:40 and do my paperwork. I screwed it up and put in the wrong date, but they took me as a walk-in and I was still seen with only a slightly longer wait. The check-in process was very efficient and quick. Went to triage, which took about 5 minutes for vitals, description of symptoms, etc. Went immediately to a room for a short wait. They tested me immediately for flu and strep so those tests could be \"percolating\" while I waited. Soon, Jackie Smith came in. She was really, really nice. My test results were reported shortly and they sent an electronic prescription across the street to Harris Teeter. Honestly, from deciding to go to getting my prescriptions was a little over an hour. The ambience was nice, also, with relaxing music and a waterfall feature. Highly recommend them. We used to go to Your Doc's In. That was OK but what a difference.",
